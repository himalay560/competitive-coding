Imagine the field is a 2D plane. Each cell is either water 'W' or a tree 'T'. 
A forest is a collection of connected trees. Two trees are 
connected if they share a side i.e. if they are adjacent to each other.

Your task is, given the information about the field, print the size of the largest forest.

Size of a forest is the number of trees in it. See the sample case for clarity

Input
First line contains the size of the matrix N. 
The next N lines contain N characters each, either 'W' or 'T'.

Output
