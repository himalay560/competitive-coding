You are given a string S. Find the number of ways to choose a pair of non-empty substrings of this string 
(let's denote them by s1 and s2) such that their concatenation s1+s2 is a palindrome.

Two pairs (s1,s2) and (s'1,s'2) are different if s1 is chosen at a different position from s'1 or s2 is chosen
at a different position from s'2.

Input
The first and only line of the input contains a single string S.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of ways to choose a valid pair of substrings.

Constraints
1=|S|=1,000
S contains only lowercase English letters

sample input
abcd

sample output
6

explanation
'aba', 'bab', 'bcb', 'cbc', 'cdc', 'dcd' are possible strings
