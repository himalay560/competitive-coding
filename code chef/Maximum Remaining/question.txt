Chef and Dhyey have become friends recently. Chef wants to test Dhyey's intelligence by giving him a puzzle to solve.

The puzzle contains an integer sequence A1,A2,…,AN. The answer to the puzzle is the maximum of A[i]%A[j], taken over all valid i, j.

Help Dhyey solve this puzzle.

Input
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the answer to the puzzle.

Constraints
2=N=10^5
1=A[i]=10^9 for each valid i

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (30 points): 1=N=1,000
Subtask #2 (70 points): 1=N=10^5
