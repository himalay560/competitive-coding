TDS always plans trips which cover exactly three places. In his last trip he spent all his money on the first two 
destinations and had to return home without visiting the final one due to his strict budget of R.

TDS asked you to help him in planning his trip expenses. He spends x amount in destination one , y  amount in destination
two, and z amount in destination three. Unfortunately, in destination two he always loses twice the amount he spends in 
destination two and in destination three he always loses 
thrice the amount he spends in destination three .i.e. x+(2y+y)+(z+3z)=R (where x,y,z>=1). You have to output the number 
of valid triplets of the amounts he could spend in the three destinations .i.e.(x,y,z).

INPUT
First line contains the number of test cases T.

Next T line contains one single integer R.

OUTPUT
For each test case print a single integer denoting the count of total valid triplets.

CONSTRAINTS

1<=T<=10
1<=R<=1000

3

Explanation
test case 1-> no triplet could be form

test case 2-> only a single triplet (3,1,1) could satisfy the equation

test case 3-> three triplet (5,1,1), (1,1,2), (2,2,1) are possible
