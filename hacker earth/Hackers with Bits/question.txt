Hackers love bits, so does Alex. Alex has just started his 
career as hacker and found a special binary array A 
(containing 0's and 1's).


In one operation, he can choose any two positions in the 
array, and can swap their values. He has to perform exactly 
one operation and maximize the length of the subarray 
containing only 1's.


Note: The positions can be different or same.


As Alex is a newbie in his field, help him for the same, and 
output the required length of the sub array containing only 
1's.


Input Format:

First line consists of one integer N, denoting the number of 
elements in the array.


Second line consists of N space-separated integers, denoting the elements of the array.


Output Format:

Print the required length of the sub array containing only 
1's.

Input Constraints:
1<=N<=100
0<=A[i]<=1

SAMPLE INPUT 
5
1 1 1 0 1

SAMPLE OUTPUT 
4

Explanation
Here N=5.

And if we choose positions 4th and  5th(1 based indexing in 
array), we can swap their values and the length of the sub-array 
(from index 1 to 4) containing only 1's, will be 4.
