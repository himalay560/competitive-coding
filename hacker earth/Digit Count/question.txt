You are given a very large number N. Let N be represented as N[1]N[2]N[3]....N[m], where m is the number of digits in N. 
You are asked Q queries. Each query is of the following form:

lr - determine the digit with the highest frequency in the range l to r, i.e N[l],N[l+1],...N[r].

Note: If there are two or more digits with the highest frequency, then print the digit with higher value.

INPUT FORMAT

First Line: N - the very large number.
Second Line: Q - the number of queries.
Next Q lines: 2 integers - l and r as described in the statement.

OUTPUT FORMAT

For each query, print two space separated integers - d and f - the digit with the highest frequency, and its frequency.

CONSTRAINTS

1<=m<=10^5
1<=Q<=5*10^5
1<=l<=r<=m
0<=N[i]<=9 (1<=i<=m)

Note that m is the number of digits in the number N

Explanation
Case 2: All digits occur only once. Hence the answer is 9 1
