You are given an array Arr of size N, containing integers. You have to answer Q queries where each query is of the form :

K L R :- If K=0, then you have to find the probability of choosing an even number from the segment [L,R] (both Inclusive) in the array Arr.

K L R :- If K=1, then you have to find the probability of choosing an odd number from the segment [L,R] (both Inclusive) in the array Arr.

For each query print two integers p and q which represent the probability p/q. Both p and q are reduced to the minimal form.

If p is 0 or p is equal to q print p/q alone.

Constraints: 

1<=T<=10
1<=N,Q<=10000
1<=Arr[i]<=1000000
0<=K<=1
1<=L<=R<=N

Format of the input file: 

First line : T i.e Number of testcases. 

For each testcase :
First line : Two space separated integers N and Q.
Second line : N space separated integers denoting the array .
Next Q lines : Three space separated integers K L and R.

Format of the output file:
Output the answer to each query in a separate line. 

SAMPLE INPUT

Explanation
For 1st query since there are no even numbers in the given range hence probability is 0.
