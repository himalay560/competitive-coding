Jayati shared an interesting game for testing memorization power with her friends. The game is:

You will get a list of words and some queries. You will be asked, to find out how many words in the list have 
a query word as a prefix.

If you will not be able to answer her queries, you will miss a chance to impress her. And at any cost, 
you want to impress her by answering quickly for each query.

Input Format:

The first line contains N, Q: the number words in list and number of queries.

N lines follow, with words (of the list) consisting of lowercase letters.
The sum of their lengths won't be greater than 10^6.

Q lines follow, with words (queries) consisting of lowercase letters. The sum of their lengths won't be greater than 10^6.

Output Format:

For each query print the number of words in the list which have actual word as the prefix.
