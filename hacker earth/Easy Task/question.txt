Daksh is one of the greatest ever players to have played football. Now, he is easily impressed by the people who loves
mathematics and can solve the problems easily. You want an autograph of this legendary player, but for that you have to 
first solve his problem. So he has a problem for you :

You are given two arrays 'A' and 'B' of equal size 'N' . Now, Daksh calls a pair of indices (i,j) connected , if i=j or A[i]=A[j].

Now, for each index i , in the array 'A' where 1<=i<=N ; you need to find the maximum B[j] , such that indices i and j are connected. Can you do it ?

Input :

The first line contains a single integer, N
The next line contains N space separated integers, where the ith integer denotes A[i] ,
The next line too contains N space separated integers, where the ith integer denotes B[i] .

Output:

Print N space separated integers according to those mentioned in the problem statement.

Constraints:

1<= N <=2*10^5
1<= A[i] <=10^9
1<= B[i] <=10^9

SAMPLE INPUT 
5
1 2 3 2 1
6 7 8 7 6

SAMPLE OUTPUT 
6 7 8 7 6

Explanation
Indices 1 and 5 are connected. Therefore the answer for indices 1 and 5 will be whichever has a larger value of B[].

Similarly, indices 2 and 4 are connected.

Index 3 is not connected to any other index.
