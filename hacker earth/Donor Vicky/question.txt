He decided to donate money to N poor people numbered 1 to N  and give one coin to each poor in increasing order of the value of the coin. after giving the coin to the Nth poor he starts the same process from 1st poor person till he donates all his money. 

If he is left with some amount whose coin he had already used he give a cheque of leftover money to the next poor in the sequence.

.For each test case print a single line denoting the index of the person getting the last coin

CONSTRAINTS

1<=T<=1000

1<=N<=100

1<=X<=10000

SAMPLE INPUT

1

Explanation
For test case 1 -> TDS will donate 1 coin to beggar 1, 2 to beggar 2, and as hi is left with less than 3 coins for beggar 3, he will give a cheque along with 1 coin, so beggar 3 would be the last to receive a coin

For TC2, the sequence is,

1->1

2->2

3->3

4->4

cycle repeats,

1+cheque->1

so ans=1
