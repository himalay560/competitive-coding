You are given two strings S and T. You need to pick some characters from the first string, some from the second string 
and then form a new string by rearranging the characters you have picked. You need to find the length of the maximum string
that you can make which will be a palindrome.

Input

The first line contains a string S as input and the next line contains a string T as input.

Output

In the output, you need to print an integer which denotes the maximum length of the palindrome that can be obtained.

Constraints
1<=|S|,|T|<=1000

SAMPLE INPUT 
aab
cba

SAMPLE OUTPUT 
5

Explanation
In the sample test case, you can form the string baaab by picking the characters from both the strings.
