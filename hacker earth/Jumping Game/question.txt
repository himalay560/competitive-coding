According to Prince, Rohit is the most intelligent guy in the Nehru Hall. To prove him wrong, Chhotta Patwari give him a problem. But Rohit is busy in preparations for the sessionals. He wants you to help him. The problem statement is:
You are standing on point 0.

You can take two moves Suppose you are at point x you can move to (x + 1)th point or (2*x)th point

The cost of moving to (x + 1)th point is a and cost of moving to (2*x)th point is b

You are required to reach the destination point n in minimum cost

Input Format:

First line contains 't' the number of test cases.
Each test case contains three integers n, a, b
n is the destination index, a is the cost of moving from x to x+1 
b is the cost of moving from x to 2*x

Output Format:

For each test case output minimum cost to reach the destination index n in a separate line.

Constraints: 
1 <= t <= 30
1 <= n <= 100000
1 <= a, b <= 1000000000
