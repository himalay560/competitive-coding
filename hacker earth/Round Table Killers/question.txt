There is a round table in which N people are sitting. You can look at the image for their seating arrangement. Initially the person numbered X holds a gun. In addition to it there is a special number K that helps in determining the persons to be killed. The killing starts as follows - Firstly the person numbered X starts and he kills a total of X%K people sitting clockwise of him and he gives gun to the person i who is sitting just next to the last person killed. Now that person also kills the next i%K people and this goes on. If at any instant the total persons that are remaining is not greater than i%K where i is the number of person holding the gun then the person i wins. You can show that sooner or later only one person remains. So your job is to decide which numbered person will win this killing game.
X%K is the remainder when X is divided by K 

Input
First line contains three numbers N , K and X as input.

Output
In the output you have to tell the number of the player who will be the winner.
Constraints
1<=N<=1000
2<=K<=N
1<=X<=N
 
SAMPLE INPUT 
5 2 3

SAMPLE OUTPUT 
3

Explanation
Initially the gun is with person 3. Value of 3%2 is 1 so he kills only one person to his clockwise i.e. 4 dies. Now gun is with person 5.  5%2 is 1 so person 1 is killed and gun is passed to person 2. 2%2 is zero and the gun is passed to 3 without killing anyone. Now again 3%2 is 1 so 5 gets killed and gun is passed to 2. Then the gun is passed to 3 again and finally he kills person 2.
